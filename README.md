# Macroeconomic Analysis of the United States

Using data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and Yahoo! Finance to analyse the macroeconomic phase of the United States in the current time. The data is collected from the year 2000 to 2020. The data is collected from the following sources:
- [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/)

A Liquid Time-Constant Neural Network (LTCNN) is used to predict the future values of the macroeconomic indicators. The advantage of an LTC NN is the capability of dynamically adjusting the time-constant and activation function of the network.

We want to predict the macroeconomic phase (trough, peak, recession and expansion) of the current time and forecast the phase for the next 1, 2, and 4 quarters respectively.
